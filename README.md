# NotnHeavy's Old Flamethrower Mechanics

Making use of `CTFFlameEntity`, which is still present in the game files, this plugin reintroduces pre-Jungle Inferno flames. I may look into other things as well with this plugin in the future.

Note that due to flame visuals being client-side and I'm not really sure how to get around truly re-creating them, the original `CTFFlameManager` entity is still spawned for flame visuals. If you would like to utilise old flame visuals, [check out this mod.](https://gamebanana.com/mods/12497)
